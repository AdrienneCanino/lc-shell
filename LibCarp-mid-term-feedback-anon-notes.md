### Mid-term feedback

(James) In addition to the skill level self-reporting you've been doing, now we've hit the half way point of Library Carpentry we'd like to know if you are feeling able to articulate ways in which what we've learnt thus far could be used in your daily practice. So for the next two minutes, please write *briefly* on a sticky note a scenario in which you imagine - that is, not necessarily right now but with a little practice - you or your team will be able to use what you've learnt thus far at work, in your libraries. And if you can't see an application, then tell us that!
