##119 Programming in Libraries

______
####Introduction

In this session we will introduce programming by looking at how data can be manipulated, counted, and mined using the Unix shell, a command line interface to your computer and the files it has access to.

Why might we want to do this? Well having accumulated data for one project, it is expected that you might ask different questions of that data when returning to it during a subsequent project. And if this data is spread across multiple files - a series of tabulated data, a set of transcribed text, a collection of images - it can be quickly manipulated, counted and mined using simple Unix commands.

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for the Linux operating system and for Unix-like systems (such as iOS). For Windows users, popular shells are Cygwin or Git Bash. This session will cover a small number of basic commands using Git Bash. These constitute building blocks upon which more complex commands can be constructed to fit your data or project, to which Andy Jackson will address this afternoon.

We'll be covering quite a lot but the key commands are in the handout for reference. We'll proceed in a follow my leader fashion. I demo a command, you copy, and then we'll discuss the results. Stickies for when you get stuck or something doesn't appear to work.

_____
####First Steps - navigating the shell

We will begin with the basics of navigating the Unix shell.

Start by opening Git Bash by double clicking on the icon on your desktop. When you run it, you will see a black window with a cursor flashing next to a dollar sign. This is our command line.

If, when opening a command window or at any other time today, you are unsure of where you are in a computer's file system, you can find out what directory you are in using `pwd` command, which stands for "print working directory", and hitting enter - which executes commands in the shell. Try typing `pwd` and hitting enter.

To orient ourselves, let's get a listing of what files are in this directory. Type `ls` and you will see a list of every file and directory within your current location.

You may want more information than just a list of files. You can do this by specifying various *flags* to go with our basic commands. These are additions to a command that provide the computer with a bit more guidance of what sort of output or manipulation you want.

If you type `ls -l` and hit enter the computer returns a long list of files that contains information similar to what you'd find in your finder or explorer: the size of the files in bites, the date it was created or last modified, and the file name.

In everyday usage you will more used to units of measurement like bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. Luckily, there's another flag `-h` that when used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.

Now `ls -h` won't work on its own. When you want to use two flags, you can just run them together. So, by typing `ls -lh` and hitting enter you receive an output in a human-readable format; you learn that that 6020 bits is also 5.9KB, that another file is 1 megabyte, and so forth. 

You've now spent a great deal of time in your home directory. Let's go somewhere else. You can do that through the `cd` or Change Directory command. 

If you type `cd desktop` you are now on your desktop. To double check, type `pwd` and you should see `/c/Users/DSTraining/desktop`

You'll note that this only takes you `down` through your directory structure (as in into more nested directories). If you want to go back, you can type `cd ..`. This moves us 'up' one directory, putting us back in `/c/Users/DSTraining/` (if we started at `.../desktop`. If you ever get completely lost, the command `cd --` will bring you right back to the home directory, right where you started.

Try exploring: move around the computer, get used to moving in and out of directories, see how different file types appear in the Unix shell. **TWO MINUTES**

Being able to navigate your file system using the bash shell is very important for using the Unix shell effectively. As you become more comfortable, you'll soon find yourself skipping directly to the directory that you want. So when you've finished moving around, type `cd c:/Users/DSTraining/desktop` and hit enter to be brought to the desktop. This takes you straight to the desktop.

Finally, if you type `explorer .` you will open up the current directory you are in with your file system explorer. Make sure to leave a space between `explorer` and the full stop.

*Summary*

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the command 'pwd' to find out where you are in on your computer
- use the command 'ls' to list directory contents
- use flags `-l` and `-lh` to guide the output of the `ls` command
- use the command `cd` to move around your computer
- use `explorer .` to open the current directory in the GUI.

______
####Interacting with Files

As well as navigating directories, you can interact with files on the command line: you can read them, open them, run them, and even edit them, often without ever having to leave the interface. There is some debate over why one would do this. The primary reason is the seamless experience of working on the command line: you never have to pick up your mouse or touch your track pad, and, although it has a steep learning curve it can eventually become your primary working environment. Furthermore, many programs require you to use the command line to operate with them. Since you'll be using programs on the command line, it can often be quicker to make small edits without switching into a separate program. For some of these arguments, see Jon Beltran de Heredia's ["Why, oh WHY, do those #?@! nutheads use vi?"](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html). 

Here's a few basic ways to interact with files. 

First, you can create a new directory. We will create it on your desktop, for convenience's sake. Navigate to your desktop, type `mkdir firstdir` and hit enter. This used the `mkdir` command (meaning 'Making Directory') to create a directory named 'firstdir'. Now, move into that directory using the `cd` command.

But wait! There's a trick to make things a bit quicker. Go up one directory (`cd ..`). To navigate to the `firstdir` directory from the desktop you could type `cd firstdir`. Alternatively, you could type `cd f` and then hit tab. You will notice that the interface completes the line to `cd firstdir`. **Hitting tab at any time within the shell will prompt it to attempt to auto-complete the line based on the files or sub-directories in the current directory. Where two or more files have the same characters, the auto-complete will only fill up to the first point of difference, after which you can add more characters, and try using tab again. We would encourage using this method throughout today to see how it behaves (as it saves loads of time and effort!).**

The next step is to manipulate files.

Navigate to another directory on your desktop: `/c/Users/DSTraining/desktop/119/text`. In here there is a copy of Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* downloaded from Project Gutenberg. type `ls -lh` and hit enter to see details of this file.

You can read the text within this file in a few different ways. First, you can tell our computer that you want to read it using the standard program that you use to open text files. By default, this will be the humble Notepad. To open a file in this way, just type `explorer 829-0.txt` and hit enter. This selects the default program to open that type of file, and opens it. 

However, you often want to just work on the command line without leaving it. You can read files within this environment as well. To try this, type `cat 829-0.txt`. The terminal window erupts and *Gulliver's Travels* cascades by. That's great, in theory, but you can't really make any sense of that amount of text. Instead, you may want to just look at the first or the last bit of the file. **TIP: to cancel this print of `829-0.txt`, or indeed any ongoing in the Unix shell, hit `ctrl+c`**

Type `head 829-0.txt` and hit enter. This provides a view of the first ten lines, whereas `tail 829-0.txt` provides a perspective on the last few lines. This is a good way to quickly determine the contents of the file.

You may also want to change the file name to something more descriptive. You can 'move' it to a new name by using the `mv` or move command. To do this type `mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt` and hit enter.

Afterwards, when you perform a `ls` command, you will see that it is now `gulliver.txt`. Had you wanted to duplicate it, you could have used the `cp` or copy command by typing `cp 829-0.txt gulliver.txt`

Now that you have seen and used several new commands, it's time for another trick. Hit the up arrow twice on your keyboard. Notice that `mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt` appears before your cursor. You can continue pressing the up arrow to cycle through your previous commands. The down arrow cycles back toward your most recent command. This is another important labour saving function and something we'll use a lot today.

After having read and renamed several files, you may wish to bring their text together into one file. Before we do that let's use `cp` to duplicate the Gulliver file and give it the filename `gulliver-backup.txt`: any ideas how you do that? ( `cp gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt`). Good, now that you have two copies of *Gulliver's Travels*, let's put them together to make an **even longer** book. 

To combine, or concatenate, two or more files use the `cat` command. Type `cat gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt` and press enter. This prints, or displays, the combined files within the shell. However, it is too long to read on this window! Luckily, by using the `>` redirector, you can send the output to a new file, rather than the terminal window. Hit up to get to your last command and amend the line to `cat gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt > gulliver-twice.txt`. Now, when you type `ls` you'll see `gulliver-twice.txt` appear in your directory.

When combining more than two files, using a wildcard can help avoid having to write out each filename individually. Again, labour saving! A useful wildcard is `*`, which is a place holder for zero or more characters or numbers. So, if you type `cat *.txt > everything-together.txt` and hit enter, a combination of all the .txt files in the current directory are combined in alphabetical order as `everything-together.txt`. This can be very useful if you need to combine a large number of smaller files within a directory so that you can work with them in a text analysis program. Another wildcard worth remembering is `?` which is a place holder for a single character or number. We shall return to wildcards later.

Now when you run a `ls` command you will see four files, two of which are the same: `gulliver.txt` and `gulliver-backup.txt`. 

<Exercise 1>

If you wanted to combine **both** (and only) `gulliver-twice.txt` and `gulliver-backup.txt`, you could use the wildcard command. 

How would you do that?

cat gulliver-* > newcopy.txt

</Exercise 1>

Onto deleting. We won't use the now, but if you do want to delete a file, for whatever reason, the command is `rm`, or remove. **Be careful with the `rm` command**, as you don't want to delete files that you do not mean to. Unlike deleting from within your Graphical User Interface, there is **no** recycling bin or undo options. For that reason, if you are in doubt, you may want to exercise caution or maintain a regular backup of your data.

The syntax for `rm` is the same as `cp` and `mv`: for example `rm gulliver.txt`, adding wildcards as appropriate to specify the files to delete.

*Summary*

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the command `mv` to rename and move files.
- use the command `cp` to create a file from an existing file.
- use the command `cat` to combine more than one file of the same file type.
- use the wildcards `*` and `?` as place holders that delimit which files are to be manipulated by a given an action.
- use the `rm` command to delete unwanted files.

####Manipulating, counting and mining research data with the Unix shell

**an aside on tidy data**

Now you can work with the unix shell you can move onto learning how to count and mine data. But before you do, we need to take a step back and think about organising data. Data held in a digital form has clear advantages over its physical antecedents: it can be browsed and searched, hosted in ways that enable access in many places, merged with or queried against other data, and manipulated programmatically. But a prerequisite of programmatic work is consistent and precise data structures.

I have a whole lesson on this over at the *Programming Historian*, but the basic lessons if you want to make your future progamming easy (which you'll see in practice next) are thus:

- Data structures should be consistent and predictable.
- Consider using semantic elements or data identifiers to structure data directories.
- Fit and adapt your data structure to suit what you do.
- Apply naming conventions to directories and file names to identify them, to create associations between data elements, and to assist with the long term readability and comprehension of your data structure.

And why do this? **Because it makes it easier for machines to do the useful things we are now going to do with those files**
_____
####Next steps - more manipulating, counting, and mining files

So far you have learnt commands which, although useful, are rather simple and may not improve your work. These building blocks are, combined with consistent file structure and naming, the foundation of a more powerful set of commands that can count and mine your data.

**Counting**

You will begin by counting the contents of files using the Unix shell. The Unix shell can be used to quickly generate counts from across files, something that is tricky to achieve using the graphical user interfaces of standard office suites.

In the Unix shell, use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory that contains our data: the `data` subdirectory of the `119` directory. Remember, if at any time you are not sure where you are in your directory structure, type `pwd` and hit enter.

Type `ls -lh` and then hit enter. This prints, or displays, a list that includes a file and a subdirectory.

The file in this directory is the dataset `2014-01_JA.csv` that contains journal article metadata.

The subdirectory is named `derived_data`. It contains a `list.txt` file (to which we shall return) and four .tsv files derived from `2014-01_JA.csv`. Each of these four includes all data where a keyword such as `africa` or `america` appears in the 'Title' field of `2014-01_JA.csv`. The `derived_data` directory also includes a subdirectory called `results`.

*Note: CSV files are those in which the units of data (or cells) are separated by commas (comma-separated-values) and TSV files are those in which they are separated by tabs. Both can be read in simple text editors or in spreadsheet programs such as Libre Office Calc or Microsoft Excel.*

Before you begin working with these files, you should move into the directory in which they are stored. Navigate to `/c/Users/DSTraining/desktop/119/data/derived_data`.

Now that you are here you can count the contents of the files.

The Unix command for counting is `wc`. Type `wc -w 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv` and hit enter. The flag `-w` combined with `wc` instructs the computer to print a word count, and the name of the file that has been counted, into the shell.

As was seen earlier today flags such as `-w` are an essential part of getting the most out of the Unix shell as they give you better control over commands.

If your research is more concerned with the number of entries (or lines) than the number of words, you can use the line count flag. Type `wc -l 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv` and hit enter. Combined with `wc` the flag `-l` prints a line count and the name of the file that has been counted.

Finally, type `wc -c 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv` and hit enter. This uses the flag `-c` in combination with the command `wc` to print a character count for `2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv`.

With these three flags, the most obvious thing we can use `wc` for is to quickly compare the shape of sources in digital format - for example word counts per page of a book, the distribution of characters per page across a collection of newspapers, the average line lengths used by poets. You can also use `wc` with a combination of wildcards and flags to build more complex queries. Can you guess what the line `wc -l 2014-01-31_JA-a*.tsv` will do? Correct! This prints the line counts for `2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv` and `2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv`, offering a simple means of comparing these two sets of research data. Of course, it may be faster if you only have a handful of files to compare the line count for the two documents in Libre Office Calc, Microsoft Excel, or a similar spreadsheet program. But when wishing to compare the line count for tens, hundreds, or thousands of documents, the Unix shell has a clear speed advantage.

Moreover, as our datasets increase in size you can use the Unix shell to do more than copy these line counts by hand, by the use of print screen, or by copy and paste methods. Using the `>` redirect operator we saw earlier you can export our query results to a new file. Type `wc -l 2014-01-31_JA-a*.tsv > results/DATE_JA-a-wc.txt` and hit enter. This runs the same query as before, but rather than print the results within the Unix shell it saves the results as `DATE_JA_a-wc.txt`. By prefacing this with `results/` the shelll is instructed to save the .txt file to the `results` sub-directory. To check this, navigate to the `results` subdirectory, hit enter, type `ls`, and hit enter again to see this file. Type 'head DATE_JA-a-wc.txt' to see the file contents in the shell (as it is 10 lines or fewer in length, all the file contents will be shown here).

**Mining**

The Unix shell can do much more than count the words, characters, and lines within a file. The `grep` command (meaning 'global regular expression print') is used to search across multiple files for specific strings of characters. It is able to do so much faster than the graphical search interface offered by most operating systems or office suites. And combined with the `>` operator, the `grep` command becomes a powerful research tool can be used to mine your data for characteristics or word clusters that appear across multiple files and then export that data to a new file. The only limitations here are your imagination, the shape of your data, and - when working with thousands or millions of files - the processing power at your disposal.

To begin using `grep`, first navigate to the `derived_data` directory (`cd ..`). Here type `grep 1999 *.tsv` and hit enter. This query looks across all files in the directory that fit the given criteria (the .tsv files) for instances of the string, or character cluster, '1999'. It then prints them within the shell.

Press the up arrow once in order to cycle back to your most recent action. Amend `grep 1999 *.tsv` to `grep -c 1999 *.tsv` and hit enter. The shell now prints the number of times the string 1999 appeared in each `*.tsv file`. If you look at the output from the previous command, this tends to be refer to the date field for each journal article. Cycle to the previous line again and amend this to `grep -c 1999 2014-01-31_JA*.tsv > results/DATE_JA-1999.txt` and hit enter. This query looks for instances of the string '1999' across all documents that fit the criteria and saves them as `DATE_JA-1999.txt` in the `results` subdirectory.

Strings need not be numbers. `grep -c revolution 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv`, for example, counts the instances of the string `revolution` within the defined files and prints those counts to the shell. Run this, observe the output, and then amend it to `grep -ci revolution 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv`. This repeats the query, but prints a case insensitive count (including instances of both `revolution` and `Revolution`). Note how the count has increased nearly 30 fold for those journal article titles that contain the keyword 'america'. As before, cycling back and adding `> results/`, followed by a filename (ideally in .txt format), will save the results to a data file.

So far we have counted strings in file and printed to the shell or to file those counts. But you can also use `grep` to create subsets of tabulated data from one or multiple files. Type `grep -i revolution 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv > results/DATE_JAi-america-britain-revolution.tsv` and hit enter. This script looks in both of the defined files and exports any lines containing `revolution` (without regard to case) to the specified .tsv file.

However if we look at this file, it contains every instance of the string 'revolution' including as a single word and as part of other words such as 'revolutionary'. This perhaps isn't as useful as we thought... Thankfully, the `-w` flag instructs `grep` to look for whole words only, giving us greater precision in our search. Type `grep -iw revolution 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv > results/DATE_JAiw-america-britain-revolution.tsv` and hit enter. This script looks in both of the defined files and exports any lines containing the whole word `revolution` (without regard to case) to the specified .tsv file.

You can use another flag, `-v`, to exclude data elements when using the `grep` command. Type `grep -civ revolution 2014*JA-a*.tsv` and hit enter. This will print to the terminal the number of lines not containing the string `revolution` in each file that matches the query (three in total).

Finally, if you wanted to search for all whole word occurrences of '1999' or 'revolution' (or indeed any list of strings) you can tell the shell to look at a file for your search criteria. Type `grep -iw --file=list.txt *.tsv > DATE_JAiw-1999-revolution.txt` and hit enter. This will look for any words in `list.txt` and export them to a new file in your current directory (note we've put this here - somewhat untidily - deliberately...).

<Exercise 2>

With the person next to you, select a word to search for and use what you have learnt do to the following:

Search for all case sensitive instances of that word in the four original files in this directory. Print you results to the shell.
- grep hero 2014*JA-*.tsv
Count all case sensitive instances of that word in the four original files in this directory. Print you results to the shell.
- grep -c hero 2014*JA-*.tsv
Count all case insensitive instances of that word in the four original files in this directory. Print you results to the shell.
- grep -ci hero 2014*JA-*.tsv
Search for all case insensitive instances of that word in the four original files in this directory. Print you results to a new .tsv file. 
Search for all case insensitive instances of that whole word in the four original files in this directory. Print you results to a new .tsv file.
Compare the line counts of the last two files.
  - wc -l FILENAMES
Open both files in Notepad++ to see the difference between searching strings and searching whole words using `grep`

</Exercise 2>

**<ANSWER 2>**

- grep hero 2014*JA-*.tsv
- grep -c hero 2014*JA-*.tsv
- grep -ci hero 2014*JA-*.tsv
- grep -i hero 2014*JA-*.tsv > new.tsv
- grep -iw hero 2014*JA-*.tsv > new2.tsv
- wc -l new*

**</ANSWER 2>**

*Recap 2*

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the `wc` command with the flags `-w` and `-l` to count the words and lines in a file or a series of files.
- use the redirector and structure `> subdirectory/filename` to save results into a subdirectory.
- use the `grep` command to search for instances of a string.
- use with `grep` the `-c` flag to count instances of a string, the `-i` flag to return a case insensitive search for a string, the `-v` flag to exclude a string from the results, and -w to return a whole word only search
- use - `--file=list.txt` to use the file `list.txt` as the source of strings used in a query
- combine these commands and flags to build complex queries in a way that suggests the potential for using the Unix shell to count and mine your research data and research projects.

###Working with free text

So far we have looked at how to use the Unix shell to manipulate, count, and mine tabulated data. Much humanities data is much messier journal article metadata. Nonetheless many of the same techniques can be applied to non-tabulated data, such as free text, we just need to think carefully about what it is we are counting and how we can get the best out of the Unix shell. 

Thankfully there are plenty of scholars out there doing this sort of work and we can borrow what they do as an introduction to working with these more complex files. So for this final exercise we're going to leap forward a little in terms of difficulty to an scenario where we won't learn about everything that is happening in detail or discuss at length each command. We're going to prepare and pull apart a text as though we were doing rigorous digital research, run through a dummy piece of research and manipulate something that works to show the potential of using the Unix shell in research. And where commands we've learnt about are used, I've left some of the figuring out to do to you - so please refer to your notes if you get stuck!

_____
####Grabbing a text, cleaning it up

*Work on this exercise with the person next to you*

Head to `c:\users\DSTraining\desktop\119\text\`. We're going to work again with the `gulliver.txt` file we saw earlier.

**SHOW THE FILE WITH `less -N gulliver.txt`**

We're going to start by using the `sed` command. The command allows you to edit files directly.

Type `sed '9352,9714d' gulliver.txt > gulliver-nofoot.txt` and hit enter.

The command `sed` in combination with the `d` value will look at `gulliver.txt` and delete all values between the rows specified. The `>` action then prompts the script to this edited text to the new file specified.

Now type `sed '1,37d' gulliver-nofoot.txt > gulliver-noheadfoot.txt` and hit enter. This does the same as before, but for the header.

You now have a cleaner text. The next step is to prepare it even further for rigorous analysis.

We now use the `tr` command, used for translating or deleting characters. Type `tr -d [:punct:] < gulliver-noheadfoot.txt > gulliver-noheadfootpunct.txt` and hit enter.

This uses the translate command and a special syntax to remove all punctuation. It also requires the use of both the output redirect `>` we have seen and the input redirect `<` we haven't seen. 

Finally regularise the text by removing all the uppercase lettering. Type `tr [:upper:] [:lower:] < gulliver-noheadfootpunct.txt > gulliver-clean.txt` and hit enter.

Open the `gulliver-clean.txt` in Notepad++. Note how the text has been transformed ready for analysis.

______
####Pulling a text apart, counting word frequencies

We are now ready to pull the text apart.

Type `tr ' ' '\n' < gulliver-clean.txt > gulliver-linebyline.txt` and hit enter.

This uses the translate command again, this time to translate every blank space into `\n` which renders as a new line. Every word in the file will now have its own line.

This isn't much use, so to get a better sense of the data we need to use another new command called `sort`. Type `sort gulliver-linebyline.txt > gulliver-ordered.txt` and hit enter.

This script uses the `sort` command to rearrange the text from its original order into an alphabetical configuration. Open the file in Notepad++ and after scrolling past some blank space you will begin to see some numbers and finally words, or at least lots of copies of 'a'!

This is looking more useful, but we can go one step further. Type `uniq -c gulliver-ordered.txt > gulliver-final.txt` and hit enter.

This script uses `uniq`, another new command, in combination with the `-c` flag to both remove duplicate lines and produce a word count of those duplicates.

**Note: there is a windows/linux issue here worth flagging about special characters**

Note that these steps can be simplifed by building 'pipes'. So...

`tr ' ' '\n' < gulliver-clean.txt | sort | uniq -c > gulliver-final.txt`

...would have done the line-by-line, sorting, and removal of duplicates in one go.

Either way we have now taken the text apart and produced a count for each word in it. This is data we can prod and poke and visualise, that can form the basis of our investigations, and can compare with other texts processed in the same way. And if we need to run a different set of transformation for a different analysis, we can return to `gulliver-clean.txt` to start that work. **note there are a few bits of punctuation in here - I've left these in deliberately as you should always bug fix! The internet is a always a good place to start searching for why this might have happened (something about the `punct` command we used...)**

And all using a few commands on an otherwise unassuming but very powerful command line.

_____
####Conclusion

In this lesson you have learned to navigate the Unix shell, to undertake some basic file counting, concatenation and deletion, to query across data for common strings, to save results and derived data, and to prepare textual data for rigorous computational analysis.

This only scratches the surface of what the Unix environment is capable of. It is hoped, however, that this session has provided a taster sufficient to prompt further investigation and productive play. 

Keep in mind that the full potential of the tools can offer may only emerge upon embedding these skills into real projects. Nonetheless, it should be clear that once your work grows, and with it your data, being able to manipulate, count and mine thousands on files is extremely useful. Even a large collection of files which do not contain any alpha-numeric data elements, such as of image files, can be easily sorted, selected and queried depending on the amount of description, of metadata contained in each filename. If not a prerequisite of working with the Unix, then taking the time to structure your data in a consistent and predictable manner is certainly a significant step towards getting the most out of Unix commands. And if you can find a way of using the Unix shell regularly - perhaps only to copy or amend files - you'll keep the basics fresh, meaning that next time you have cause to use the Unix shell for more complex commands, you shouldn't need to learn it all over again.

####Where to go next

Deborah S. Ray and Eric J. Ray, *Unix and Linux: visual quickstart guide*, 4th edition (2009). Invaluable (and not expensive) as a reference guide - especially if you only use the command line sporadically!

The Command Line Crash Course http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ 'learn code the hard way' -- good for reminders of the basics.

Coursera Computer Science 101 https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101 If you feel you need some context to what we've done today, this is ideal covering how computers work, jargon, and key concepts in programming (such as loops and logic). Free, doesn't have to be taken as a class but in your own time.

Another Coursera course, Programming for Everybody (Python) https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn , started today and lasts 10 weeks. So if you have 2-4 hours to spare. Python is popular in research programming as it is readable, relatively simple, and very powerful.

Bill Turkel and the Digital History community more broadly. The second lesson you did today was based on a lesson Bill has on his website http://williamjturkel.net/2013/06/15/basic-text-analysis-with-command-line-tools-in-linux/ and Bill is also a general editor of the Programming Historian http://programminghistorian.org/project-team ProgHist is an open, collaborative book aimed at providing programming lessons to historians. Although the lessons are hooked around problems historians have, their lessons - which cover various programming languages - have a wide applicability - indeed today's course is based on two lessons I wrote with Ian Milligan, an historian at Waterloo, Canada - for ProgHist. Bill also has a wonderful tutorial on ['Named Entity Recognition with Command Line Tools in Linux'](http://williamjturkel.net/2013/06/30/named-entity-recognition-with-command-line-tools-in-linux/) which I thoroughly recommend if you want to automatically find, markup, and count names, places, and organisations in text files.

I first scoped out this lesson after attending a Software Carpentry bootcamp. Software Carpentry is a Mozilla initiative that holds two days events aimed at teaching lab skills for scientific computing. But the topics covered - from command line, to Python and Git - typically have wider applicability http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html There aren't any open camps planned in the UK at present, but they are worth keeping an eye on.

Digital Research Team clinics! 2pm, our team area, every week - no agenda, no question to hard or simple.
